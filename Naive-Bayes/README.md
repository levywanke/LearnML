# Naive Bayes Classifier


* Naive Bayes classifiers are highly efficient for large datasets and perform particularly well on high-dimensional data (like text classification). Here’s a recap of what we covered:

* Data Preparation: Load, inspect, clean, and preprocess the dataset.
* Feature Engineering: Encode categorical variables and standardize features.
* Train-Test Split: Separate data for training and evaluation.
* Model Training and Prediction: Gaussian Naive Bayes was used for its probabilistic approach, assuming feature independence.
* Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, F1 score, and confusion matrix were used to assess the classifier’s performance.
