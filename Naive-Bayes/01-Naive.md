Explanation of Each Step
Data Loading and Initial Inspection:

The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv() to bring it into a Pandas DataFrame.
head(), describe(), and info() provide an overview of the data, including the first few rows, statistical summaries, and data types.
Visualizations (salary distribution and correlation heatmap) are added for a better understanding of data distribution and feature relationships.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Drop Unnecessary Columns: The User ID column is dropped since it’s an identifier that doesn’t contribute to predicting the target.
Encoding Categorical Features: Gender is mapped to binary values (Male: 1, Female: 0) to make it compatible with numerical operations.
Defining Features and Target: X includes the relevant features (Age and EstimatedSalary), while y represents the target variable (Purchased).
Train-Test Split:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets with train_test_split(). Here, 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% for testing, allowing the model to learn from the majority of data and generalize to new data.
random_state=42 ensures reproducible results.
Feature Scaling:

Standardization: The features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model. Scaling is especially crucial for Naive Bayes, as it relies on distance-based metrics.
Model Training:

The GaussianNB() classifier (Gaussian Naive Bayes) is initialized and trained on X_train and y_train. This model assumes that feature values follow a normal distribution, which works well for continuous data.
Making Predictions:

Using the trained model, predictions are made on the test set (X_test). These predictions are stored in y_pred.
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions.
Precision: Indicates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions (important for unbalanced classes).
F1 Score: Combines precision and recall to provide a single score (useful for unbalanced classes).
Classification Report: Offers precision, recall, and F1 score for each class, giving a more detailed evaluation.
Confusion Matrix: A heatmap shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing insight into classification performance for each class.
