# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and widely-used supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and   regression        tasks. KNN works by finding the “k” data points in the training set that are closest to the new data point (based on  distance) and making predictions based on these neighbors.
