Data Loading and Initial Inspection:

The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv().
head() and describe() methods provide a preview of the data and basic statistics.
isnull().sum() checks for missing values in each column, crucial for data cleaning.
Handling Missing Values:

For categorical columns with missing values, the code fills them using the mode (most frequent value).
This step ensures there are no NaN values, which could disrupt the model training process.
Dropping Unnecessary Columns:

The Loan_ID column is removed since it is just an identifier and doesnâ€™t contribute to the loan approval decision.
Encoding Categorical Variables:

Categorical variables (Gender, Married, Education, Self_Employed, Property_Area, and Loan_Status) are converted to numeric values to make the data compatible with the KNN algorithm.
The categorical mappings dictionary is used for direct replacement, ensuring consistent and interpretable encoding.
Dependents has a value '3+', which is replaced with 3 and converted to an integer type.
Splitting the Data:

train_test_split() divides the data into training and testing sets (75% training, 25% testing).
Stratification on y ensures that both training and testing sets have a similar distribution of classes.
Training the KNN Model:

A K-Nearest Neighbors classifier is initialized with n_neighbors=5.
The model is trained on the training data using fit().
Making Predictions and Evaluating the Model:

The trained model is used to predict loan approval on the test set.
The accuracy is calculated using accuracy_score(), indicating the percentage of correct predictions.
The confusion matrix, obtained with confusion_matrix(), shows the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It provides detailed insight into model performance on each class.
Visualization of the Confusion Matrix:

A heatmap visualizes the confusion matrix, with labels indicating whether loans were correctly predicted as approved or not approved.
Important Considerations
Choosing the Value of k: In this example, k=5 was chosen arbitrarily, but tuning k (using cross-validation) could improve accuracy.
Scaling Features: KNN relies on distance metrics, so scaling features with StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler may improve performance.
Class Imbalance: If classes are imbalanced, consider adjusting stratify during train-test split or using additional metrics like precision and recall for better evaluation.
