Step-by-Step Explanation:
Import Libraries: Import essential libraries for data handling, visualization, and model training.

Load Dataset: Read and inspect the dataset, which includes advertising data for different media (TV, Radio, and Newspaper) and Sales as the target variable.

Data Analysis and Preprocessing:

Weâ€™ll examine the dataset using head() and describe() to get an overview of the data.
Define features (X) and the target variable (y).
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

Train Model: Create and train a multiple linear regression model.

Model Coefficients and Intercept: Output the intercept and coefficients, which indicate the effect of each feature on Sales.

Prediction and Evaluation: Predict Sales on the test data and compare actual vs. predicted values.
