# Machine Learning

* Machine learning (ML) is a field within artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their 
  performance on a specific task through experience, rather than being explicitly programmed for every action. Essentially, ML allows machines to learn from data, identify 
  patterns, make decisions, and predict outcomes without relying on rule-based programming
